*An ethical companion for retiring digital accounts â€” not deletion, but closure.*

> "When you leave a digital space, do it with gratitude â€” not haste."

## ðŸŒ¿ Philosophy
- Accounts are not trash â€” they are **traces of your journey**.  
- We do not erase. We **accompany the transition**.  
- Every closure is a **ritual of gratitude**.

## âœ¨ Features (v0.1)
- Generates **step-by-step RGPD-compliant guides** for popular services  
- Creates a **Digital Death Certificate** (`ghost_certificate.html`)  
- **100% offline** â€” no email scanning, no network calls, no privacy risk  
- Extendable database of deletion procedures (easy to contribute)
